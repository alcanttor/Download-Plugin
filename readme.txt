>Must-have utility plugin that allows you to download any plugin directly from WordPress Dashboard!

WordPress download plugin is a utility plugin that does one thing, and does it perfectly. It may sound simple, but this feature plugs a hole in current set of WordPress plugin functionality. As a site admin you must be aware that you can search and install WordPress plugins directly from the dashboard, or you can upload the plugin as zip files, assuming you received it from another site (for example, a commercial plugin). Once installed, all plugins list themselves inside Dashboard —> Plugins page. After deactivating and deleting them, they simply disappear. All files are removed from the server instantly. WordPress does not allows you to backup or download the plugins before you jettison them from your site. If you also manage your server, and are fairly comfortable doing so, you may find a more contrived way to download installed plugins via directory manager app or FTP. Obviously, this requires more than a single click and not for everyone. 

What exactly are plugins and how this plugin helps you save time or bail you out from difficult situations? Plugins are files and/ or directories which are created inside your WordPress installation (defined by Wordpress) when you first install them. Both active and deactivated files reside inside them. When you upload zip package of a plugin, WordPress extracts it and places the directory inside it in the plugins folder. Our plugin allows you to reverse the process. It will convert any plugin installed on your site into a zip package ready to be reinstalled later or moved to another site. It accomplishes this by simply adding a new link ‘Download’ under the plugin title to already existing links. It is a single click process and hardly takes any time. Our plugin does not creates any other page in the dashboard or clutter menus. It is lightweight, efficient and completely invisible until you need it.

= B. Premium/ Commercial Plugins =
If you have purchased the plugin from a vendor site, you may want to make a backup of your new purchase to make sure you have it handy if the vendor is no longer available or your account is expired. Please note: Do check terms of use for commercial plugins on publisher’s site.

= C. Migrating to a different site =
So you have found yourselves dependent on some specific plugins which you want to use on all of your sites? You can download these plugins from your current site do a folder on your hard disk from where you can upload to your other sites.

= D. Preserving Changes =
If you DIY type and made modifications to plugin files to suit your requirements, you will want to make sure you have an archived copy of the plugin if the files get overwritten by an update etc.
